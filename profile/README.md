# Boxia

We're building the productivity platform we always wished existed.

## What We Do

All-in-one workspace for notes, tasks, calendar, files, email, and more. Everything connects. Everything's powered by AI that actually makes you faster. No more juggling twelve apps just to get through your day.

## Why We're Here

We got tired of clunky productivity tools that got in the way instead of helping. So we built something different. Fast, polished, AI-first. Tools that amplify your thinking instead of cluttering it.

Our AI agent Kairo lives across every surface and helps you actually get stuff done. Boxia Tab predicts what you need next in under 100ms. Your work becomes a living knowledge graph that gets smarter over time.

## Philosophy

Ship fast. Iterate faster. Care about craft. Make work feel human.
