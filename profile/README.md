# Coline

The All in One Productivity Platform of Vancouver.

## What We Do

Coline brings notes, tasks, calendar, files, email, and more into one connected space. Everything works together. Everything is supported by thoughtful AI that helps you move through your day with less friction and more clarity.

## Why We Exist

We wanted a workspace that felt simple, smooth, and genuinely helpful. Something that stayed out of the way and made room for real focus. Since we could not find it, we started building it.

Kairo, our AI agent, is there to support you wherever you are in the platform. Coline Tab suggests what you might need next within a blink. Your work grows into a knowledge graph that becomes more helpful the more you use it.

## How We Build

Take care with the details. Move with purpose. Keep things human. Create tools that feel good to use.

## Join Us

We are a small team building something we truly believe in. If you care about thoughtful design and meaningful tools, we would love to hear from you.
